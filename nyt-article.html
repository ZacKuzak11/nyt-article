<h2>New Allegations Emerge in "Rust" Shooting: Baldwin Accused of Intentional Action Amid Secret Affair, Blackmail Claims</h2>
<p><strong>By Julia Jacobs</strong> | April 13, 2025</p>

<p>In a dramatic turn in the "Rust" shooting investigation, newly unsealed court documents and private correspondence suggest that Alec Baldwin may have intentionally fired the gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021, motivated by an alleged affair and escalating blackmail threats.</p>

<p>The documents—disclosed as part of a civil suit filed in Santa Fe County this week—include transcripts of messages, call logs, and testimonies from unnamed sources close to both Baldwin and Hutchins. These suggest that Baldwin and Hutchins had been involved in a brief but intense romantic relationship during the early stages of "Rust" production.</p>

<p>One unnamed production assistant, listed in the court filing as "R.M.," claimed under oath that Hutchins had become increasingly distraught in the days leading up to the fatal shooting. "She told me Alec was going to 'make things right or everything goes public,'" the deposition states. "She had screenshots, photos... She said he was scared of what would happen to his career."</p>

<p>Baldwin's legal team has not responded to multiple requests for comment. In a brief statement issued Friday through his publicist, Matthew Horowitz, Baldwin denied all allegations, calling the claims "categorically false, salacious, and desperate attempts to derail the truth."</p>

<p>However, internal memos from the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Department—leaked early Thursday via a whistleblower—describe private texts allegedly pulled from Hutchins' phone. In one exchange dated October 15, 2021, just six days before the shooting, Hutchins writes: "You can't just erase me, Alec. If I go down, you go with me."</p>

<h2>A Timeline Re-Examined</h2>
<p>The new allegations contradict Baldwin's long-held public defense that he "never pulled the trigger," an assertion he reiterated in a 2021 interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. However, a revised forensic report, released quietly last month, showed microscopic wear on the gun's trigger mechanism that suggests "direct pressure was applied prior to discharge," contradicting earlier claims of a misfire. "This changes everything," said legal analyst Carmen Ortega. "If these texts and testimonies hold up, prosecutors may reopen the case—not just as a tragic accident but as a potential second-degree murder investigation."</p>

<h2>Industry Fallout and Public Response</h2>
<p>The revelations have sent shockwaves through Hollywood. Film unions, which have already pushed for tighter on-set safety standards following Hutchins' death, are now demanding a re-evaluation of insurance protections and ethical oversight.</p>

<p>Actress Florence Pugh, a close friend of Hutchins, posted a cryptic message on Instagram hours after the story broke: "Some secrets were never meant to stay buried. Justice is patient. #HalynaHutchins." Other figures, including actor George Clooney—who previously criticized Baldwin's handling of the weapon—have remained silent as of Saturday.</p>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>Whether these explosive claims hold legal weight remains to be seen. While the District Attorney's office has not confirmed whether they will reopen the case, sources inside the investigation told The Times that "everything is back on the table."</p>

<p>A hearing has been scheduled for May 3rd in Santa Fe to assess the admissibility of the new evidence. Halyna Hutchins' family has yet to publicly comment on the latest developments. Their attorney, Gloria Martinez, issued a short statement: "We are reviewing these materials and will proceed as appropriate."</p>

<p class="correction"><strong>A Correction was made on April 13, 2025:</strong> An earlier version of this article misstated the date of the leaked court documents; they were made public April 10, not April 8.</p>
